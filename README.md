## 📖 Summary

It was a quiet Tuesday when I received an email warning me of a supposed password breach. It looked official—logos, tone, formatting. But one thing was off: the URL. It was close... but not quite right.

This wasn’t just spam. It was **targeted phishing**.

I didn’t click. I investigated.
